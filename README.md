Labs for BADS
=============

A set of exploratory assignments designed for the course BADS
“Algorithms and Data Structures” at IT University of Copenhagen.

Every lab has its own directory and contains two subdirectories:

    <labname>/data     -- data files
    <labname>/docs     -- lab documentation (LaTeX), including a
                          report skeleton

Installation
------------

To make the documentation, you need an up-to-date (2012) version of
LaTeX. 

To create all labs:
   make all

To make an individual lab, run:
    make <labname>/docs/<labname>.pdf
